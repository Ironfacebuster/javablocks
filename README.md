### Alternate names: JavaNodes, Nodes

Nodes is a node based programming system, written entirely in JavaScript, running in your browser! Think of it like Scratch, but rather than blocks, you make connections between nodes!

Want to try it out? Go [here!](https://javablocks.herokuapp.com/html/index.html) 

(**Notice:** this is a **free** Heroku deployment, so it'll probably be offline nearing the end of every month)

Known issues:
* Nodes aren't properly synced in execution. You'll find out what I mean.
* You can't change Node I/O types, but I plan on making these dynamically assigned.
* Custom nodes are very limited.
* There's no real output yet, I know.

## Find any issues?
Be sure to report them in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/javablocks/issues)!
The best way to improve the codebase is by finding all the weird bugs and quirks, and squashing them!

## Have any suggestions?
You can tell me about them in the [issues tab](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/javablocks/issues)!

## Got better code?
Make a [pull request](https://github.com/Ironfacebuster/javablocks/pulls)!
If it ends up being better than what I have (which is pretty likely), I'll merge it!
